# React Projects

This repository contains a collection of basic to intermediate-level React projects that I have created to enhance my skills and understanding of the React library. These projects cover a wide range of functionalities and concepts, including dynamic components, state management, event handling, and API integration.

## Projects

1. **Dynamic Accordion**: A collapsible component that allows users to toggle the visibility of content sections.

2. **Random Color Generator**: A simple app that generates random colors and displays them on the screen.

3. **Star Ratings**: A reusable component that renders star ratings based on user input or defined values.

4. **Image Slider**: A carousel-style component that cycles through a set of images with navigation controls.

5. **Tree View**: A nested list component that allows users to expand and collapse nodes, with the ability to link references.

6. **QR Code Generator**: An app that generates QR codes based on user input.

7. **Theme Changer**: A feature that allows users to switch between light and dark themes.

8. **Scroll Indicator**: A visual indicator that shows the user's progress while scrolling through a page or content.

9. **Modal Popup**: A reusable modal component that accepts props from its parent and displays the content in a popup window.

10. **Auto-complete**: An input field that provides suggestions as the user types, allowing them to select and insert the desired word.

11. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**: A classic game of tic-tac-toe implemented with React.

12. **React Hooks**: Examples and demonstrations of various React hooks, such as useState, useEffect, useContext, and more.

13. **Custom Hooks**: Examples of custom hooks created to encapsulate reusable logic.

14. **API Fetching**: Projects that fetch data from external APIs and display or process the retrieved information.
